# Shaping the perfect python notebook environment
(at least for me)

## Why
Once you have experience developing R using Rmarkdown in Rstudio, everything else looks like a pale attempt to imitate perfection.

I understand that the prototypical python developer _should_ be a serious and rough guy who doesn't mind suffering and adapting to develop in win notepad. Instead I believe that developing code is already burdening your brain enough (a very pleasant burden, I beg to stress) that you should not worry about the quirks of a poor development environment. 

After long experimentations with many different environments, I found the perfect environment for me. Maybe it can help you too.

It is not as perfect as RStudio, but that's the closest I got to. If you have suggestions for improvements, you are more than welcome.

For scripts development, I find VS code unparalleled. It automatically detects local virtual environments (hereafter venv) and allows you to evaluate 

For notebooks, I find VS code still a bit in its early stage: there can be confusion between evaluating lines/cells in the associated terminal or in the interactive viewer, and also plots and tables appear in the interactive viewer, rather than inline.

Importantly - _very_ importantantly for me - you cannot evaluate a single line/selection inside a code cell. 

To be fair, the (my) perfect python notebook development environment _did already exist_: it was in the beautiful Atom editor with the Hydrogen extension. However, sadly in 2022 the decision was taken to "sunset" it, so now it can be a real hassle to make it work.
